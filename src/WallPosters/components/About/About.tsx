        I am Vida Hasson, a music critic and zinester based in Seattle and San
        Francisco. I write and I write and I write album reviews, book reviews,
        and zines. I also conduct interviews. No boring questions! ~ Welcome to
        my room. Find my book reviews in the bookshelf. Album reviews are in the
        posters (archive in the record collection). Interviews in the icon.
